A simple facebook bot that generates random prnt.sc links, downloads the images and posts them on facebook.
For now it doesn't really do anything interesting, but I have some ideas that could make it more dynamic.

#### Current features.
- Download images.
- Makes basic posts on facebook (includes image, message and self reaction)
- Posts an image each 15 minutes.

#### Future improvements.
- Filter images before upload (NSFW content).
- Separate the classes properly.
- Resize excesive large images to a standar max size.
- Add the classic perhaps low res image to commments.
- Add some get hits , i.e: kot420.
